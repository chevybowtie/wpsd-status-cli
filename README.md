# WPSD Status CLI

The **WPSD Status CLI** is a Bash script that provides a dynamic, live update interface for monitoring WPSD status information. It fetches data from a backend web service and displays it in the terminal with a clean and interactive interface.


## Features

- **Live Updates**: Continuously fetches and displays WPSD status information at regular intervals.
- **Dynamic ASCII Art**: Displays call signs in large text using `figlet`.
- **Customizable Refresh**: Set the refresh interval for live updates.
- **Interactive Exit**: Press `q` at any time to gracefully exit the script.



## Requirements

### Tools:
- `bash` (script interpreter) - WPSD already has this
- `curl` (for fetching data) - WPSD already has this
- `figlet` (for large ASCII text rendering) - don't recall if this was installed by me or it was already present

### Install Dependencies:

1. Install figlet:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install figlet   
  ```
